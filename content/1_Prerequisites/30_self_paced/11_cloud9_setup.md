[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that let you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.

We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS account via the AWS CLI in this workshop, modify build configuration and more. There are a few steps to complete to set this up:

1. Within the AWS console, use the region drop list to select **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**.  This will ensure the workshop script provisions the resources in this same region

2. Navigate to the [cloud9 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) or just search for it under the **AWS console services** menu

3. Click the **Create environment** button

4. For the name use `aws-workshop`, then click **Next step**

5. Select the default instance type **t3.small**

6. Leave all the other settings as default and click **Next step** followed by **Create environment**

Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the [specific domains]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-env-loading). Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.

Now we will attach the proper role to our Cloud9 EC2 instance and configure a bit more our Cloud9 environment:

Cloud9 normally manages IAM credentials dynamically. This isn't currently compatible with
the EKS IAM authentication, so we will disable it and rely on the IAM role instead.

# Minimizing Open&nbsp;Source Dependency Risks

![Mend Logo](/images/Mend-Logo_Dark_Horizontal_withTagLine.svg)

## Introduction

Application developers are increasingly relying on open-source to deliver software at a faster pace, and open source now comprises over 70% of the typical application code base.  

At the same time, attacks on applications have increased. Today, applications are the #1 target and the biggest security risk that enterprise security teams face. The number of software supply chain attacks increased by 650% from 2020 to 2021.  

For these reasons, open source software needs to be secured. Join Mend in a hands-on virtual workshop where you’ll learn how to implement open-source security best-practices early in your workflow using AWS Development tools.  

You will have the opportunity to learn best practices for protecting your code early in the development life cycle with [Mend SCA](https://www.mend.io/open-source-security/) and save time and reduce risk by automating dependency updates in your software projects with [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) implemented inside your AWS development tools [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/).  

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to identify open-source security vulnerabilities in your code using [Mend SCA](https://www.mend.io/open-source-security/), and save time and reduce risk by automating dependency updates in your software projects with [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) from within your AWS development tools [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/).  

## Audience
This workshop is intended for Developers, DevOps and AppSec champions and is particularly beneficial for those who are experienced with AWS Dev-Tools.

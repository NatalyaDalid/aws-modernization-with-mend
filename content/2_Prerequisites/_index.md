<p style='text-align: left;'>
For this workshop, you will be setting up a Mend user account dedicated for this workshop, in a process that slightly varies from the way users are typically provisioned in Mend.  
This user account will only be active for a limited evaluation period, after which both the user account and any data created by it will be permanently deleted.
